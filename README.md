# community

Coming Soon!

As the TokenWalk community continues to grow with developers, DAO members, and all types of creators and builders, we will update this section to highlight interesting aspects of the community.

This repo is currently used to provide a community guide for open source contribution to the TokenWalk software stack. Currently focused only on the TokenWalk dApp.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for more info!
